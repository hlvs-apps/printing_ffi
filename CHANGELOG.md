## 0.1.0

* ✨ **FEAT(android)**: Android is now a supported platform. The plugin bundles a private CUPS server (for network/office IPP printing) and DNP/Citizen dye-sub USB auto-detect, cross-compiled from source (CUPS + Gutenprint + libusb) during the app's Gradle build — no prebuilt binaries are shipped. 📱🖨️
* ✨ **FEAT(android)**: One-call boot — `await PrintingFfi.instance.initializeAndroidCups()` starts the bundled cupsd and DNP USB auto-detect (no-op off Android). Observe progress via `cupsStatus` and detected printers via `dnpPrinters`.
* ✨ **FEAT(android)**: In-app CUPS settings without building any widgets — `openCupsSettings(context)` (admin page) and `openCupsPrinterSettings(context, printerName: ...)` (per-printer page), backed by the bundled `CupsWebView`.
* ✨ **FEAT**: Exposed `cupsServerPort` plus `cupsBaseUrl` / `cupsSettingsUrl` / `cupsPrinterSettingsUrl(name)` so apps can reach the in-app cupsd without tracking the port themselves.
* ✨ **FEAT(android)**: The CUPS IPP read/control operations now work on Android against the bundled cupsd — reading printer attributes and supported options (`cupsGetPrinterAttribute`/`cupsGetPrinterAttributes`/`getSupportedCupsOptions`), job control (hold/release/move/priority), and printer enable/disable/accept/reject. They previously threw "only supported on macOS and Linux". The example gains "Open CUPS settings" and "Read printer attributes" buttons for testing.
* 🐛 **FIX(android)**: DNP printer settings (default media size, quality, etc.) now persist across USB unplug/replug and app restarts — the CUPS queue is kept and reused instead of being deleted and recreated from a fresh PPD.
* 🐛 **FIX(android)**: The CUPS web admin UI now renders in the device locale (a German phone shows German, English fallback) instead of always Russian, and its CSS/images load correctly (docroot files are made world-readable so cupsd will serve them).
* ♻️ **REFACTOR(android)**: All Android glue — the from-source native build, the Kotlin `FlutterPlugin` (USB permission, fd handoff, foreground service, asset extraction), the USB device filter, and the Dart orchestration — now lives in the plugin. A consuming desktop app adds Android with build config, one manifest filter, and one Dart call.
* 🧪 **TEST**: Added mock tests for the CUPS web-UI URL helpers (null-guard + printer-name percent-encoding).
* 📝 **DOCS**: Added `docs/android-migration-guide.md` (a gphoto-style guide for adding the Android target) and `docs/android-plugin-reusability-plan.md` (the locked execution plan, reviewed via `/plan-eng-review` + codex).


## 0.0.12

* ✨ **FEAT**: Added `printFileWithDialog` to open the native OS print dialog for any file type, providing a familiar user experience.
* ✨ **FEAT**: Improved error handling for `printFileWithDialog` on macOS/Linux by capturing and returning detailed error messages from the `lpr` command (e.g., "default destination does not exist").
* **REFACTOR**: Renamed `printPdfWithDialog` to `printFileWithDialog` for clarity and to reflect its broader capability.
* **TEST**: Added mock tests for the new `printFileWithDialog` functionality.
* **DOCS**: Updated `README.md` and the example app to demonstrate the new system print dialog feature.


## 0.0.10

* ✨ **FEAT**: Added support for printing multiple copies of PDF documents on Windows. The printer driver now handles copy collation, improving performance and reliability. 🔢
* ✨ **FEAT**: Exposed `initPdfium()` for explicit PDFium library initialization on Windows. This improves compatibility with other PDF plugins (like `pdfrx`) and ensures thread-safe, idempotent initialization.
* ✨ **FEAT**: Added a `PdfRotation` option for PDF printing on Windows, allowing users to override the document's default rotation (e.g., `auto`, `none`, `rotate90`).
* ✨ **FEAT**: Added a comprehensive suite of mock tests using `mocktail` to validate class behavior, including synchronous and asynchronous methods, without requiring a native environment.
* **REFACTOR**: Simplified the Windows PDF printing implementation by removing the manual copy loop. The native `dmCopies` setting in the `DEVMODE` structure is now used, delegating the work to the printer driver for better efficiency. ♻️
* **REFACTOR**: Refactored the `PrintingFfi` class to support dependency injection, significantly improving testability. This includes a new `PrintingFfi.forTest` constructor for injecting mock bindings. 🧪
* ✨ **FEAT(example)**: The example app now includes fields to specify the number of copies and select page rotation for PDF printing.
* ✨ **FEAT(example)**: Enhanced the print job status tracking dialog with more detailed feedback, clearer status transitions, and a synthetic "completed" status for finished jobs.
* **FIX**: Corrected the dynamic library (`.dylib`) loading logic on macOS to work reliably in both test and application environments. 🐛
* **FIX**: Implemented `shutdown_pdfium_library()` to ensure proper cleanup of PDFium resources on Windows, preventing potential resource leaks. 🛠️
* **FIX**: Ensured the `PrintingFfi` private constructor correctly initializes native bindings, preventing potential runtime errors. 🛠️
* **BUILD**: Removed unnecessary `android` and `ios` platform declarations from `pubspec.yaml`.
